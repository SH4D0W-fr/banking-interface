## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this in a FiveM server?**  
Yes. You can embed it into a NUI resource and trigger server events using Lua/JS. But please give credits.

You must contact me first. Please note that this interface is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license, which requires you to keep the code open source, even if modified.

**Q: Is it mobile-friendly?**  
No. The UI is not responsive and don't works on mobile devices, because I made it for a future FiveM script.

Yes. You'll need to handle user sessions and dynamic data from your backend.
